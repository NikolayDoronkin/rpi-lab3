  "main.about1": "Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the\nindustry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and\nscrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap\ninto electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is\nnot simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over\n2000 years old.",
  "main.about2": "It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when\nlooking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution\nof letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.\nThere are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered\nalteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly\nbelievable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything\nembarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat\npredefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet.",
